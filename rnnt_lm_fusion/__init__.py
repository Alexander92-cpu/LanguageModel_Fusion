"""
Module for language model evaluation, training, optimization, and rescoring.

This module provides classes and utilities for various tasks related to language models:

- `DataPool`: A class for managing data.
- `LMPool`: A class for managing language model training.
- `TextDataset`: A dataset class for text data.
- `Optimizator`: A class for identifying the optimal hyperparameters used in rescoring.
- `Rescore`: A class for rescoring ASR model outputs.
- `RescoreOutput`: A class representing the output of a rescore process.

Attributes:
    __all__ (list): A list containing the names of all classes and utilities
                    exported by this module.
